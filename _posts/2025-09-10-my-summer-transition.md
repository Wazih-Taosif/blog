# My Summer Transition from Junior to Senior Year of High School

This summer felt like a well-earned checkpoint in the game of high school. After the grind of junior year, I gave myself permission to breathe-and play. Most days were spent gaming with friends, laughing over voice chat, and teaming up for late-night raids or competitive matches. However it wasn't just about the games-it was about connection. These moments reminded me how important it is to have fun and build connections with the people who get you.
