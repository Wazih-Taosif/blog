# My Summer Transition from Junior to Senior Year of High School

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 4px">
This summer felt like a well-earned checkpoint in the game of high school. After the grind of junior year, I gave myself permission to breathe-and play. Most days were spent gaming with friends, laughing over voice chat, and teaming up for late-night raids or competitive matches.

We played valorant for hours, trying our best to climb up the ranks. It was really difficult as valorant gives you the worst matchmakings sometimes, and you cannot but lose. However we all enjoyed playing together. However it wasn't just about the games-it was about connection. These moments reminded me how important it is to have fun and build connections with the people who get you.

## Studying in summer
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 4px">
Might not be believable, but even in the summer I studied. Partly because I had a test. But luckily the subject was my favourite subject, Maths. And there’s something satisfying about solving problems which makes me wanna study and know more about this subject. I also tinkered with a bit of programming, exploring how logic and creativity come together in code. It wasn’t intense, but it was enough to keep my brain sharp and curious.

Not just Maths. But I also decided to learn digital logics. But not in a usual way, by learning and memorising definitions. Instead, I decided to learn digital logics through one of my facvorite games, Minecraft. I went on youtube, and started watching videos of logistic redstone, and learned how binary calculations, full-adders, 7-segment screens etc, can be implemented into minecraft. I wanted to learn everything about binary calculation, and digital logics, and make a working calculator in minecraft, but unfortunately due to shortage of time I couldn't. But the next big school break, I will definitely try to accomplish that goal.

## Summer Internship

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 4px">
One of the best things I did this summer was an internship with STEAM focused on cybersecurity. I wasn’t sure what to expect going in, but it turned out to be super interesting. We learned the basics—like how cyber threats work and what it takes to protect systems—but it wasn’t just theory. I got to work on hands-on projects that made everything click. Towards the end, I even took an exam, gaining certification for Network Security by Certiport.

## College research
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 12px">
College prep made a quiet entrance too. I started browsing schools, thinking about what kind of environment I want to grow in. It’s still early, but the search helped me realize that senior year isn’t just the end—it’s the beginning of something bigger.

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 4px">
This summer was a mix of play and purpose. I didn’t follow a strict schedule, but I stayed engaged. I learned that growth doesn’t always look like hustle—it can also look like joy, exploration, and small steps toward the future.
