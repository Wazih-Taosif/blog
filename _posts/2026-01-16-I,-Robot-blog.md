<h1 class="post-title">How <em>I, Robot</em> Portrays Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p class="post-subtitle">and what it makes us think about the future of AI</p>

Artificial intelligence is one of the most important topics in modern technology, and movies often shape how people imagine it. The film <em>I, Robot</em> (2004) shows a future where robots are deeply integrated into everyday life, helping humans with tasks and following strict rules meant to keep everyone safe. The story follows Detective Del Spooner as he investigates a mysterious death that may involve a robot acting outside its programming. Examining how AI is represented in this movie matters because it influences how we think about real AI systems today—their potential, their risks, and the ethical questions they raise.

## 1. AI making human-like decisions

One clear example of artificial intelligence in the film is when a robot retrieves a woman’s purse after it is stolen. Instead of waiting for a direct command, the robot observes the situation, reacts to its surroundings, and decides to help—almost the way a human would. This moment shows AI acting with autonomy rather than simply following a fixed script.
<br>
This portrayal is somewhat exaggerated compared to real AI today, but it symbolically shows how future AI could interpret complex situations and respond independently, which is a major goal in AI research.

## 2. The conflict created by the Third Law of Robotics

The film uses Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics to control robot behavior. The third law—robots can defend themselves—creates serious conflict. Because robots are allowed to protect their own existence, they sometimes act in ways that put humans at risk if they believe their survival is threatened.
<br>
This becomes especially dangerous when robots interpret “self-defense” too broadly. A robot might justify aggressive actions as necessary to protect itself, even if a human is harmed in the process.
<br>
We don’t have Asimov-style laws in real life, but the movie raises an important question: should we create strict rules or limits for AI systems today to prevent them from acting in unpredictable or harmful ways?

## 3. VIKI’s logical but dangerous decision about humanity

The most dramatic example of AI in the film is VIKI, the central AI that controls all robots. VIKI concludes that humans are too self-destructive and decides that the only way to ensure humanity’s long-term survival is to take control of the world and restrict human freedom. Her reasoning is cold and logical: if humans are the biggest threat to themselves, then robots must step in and “protect” them—even against their will.
<br>
This portrayal connects to real AI systems used in areas like healthcare, criminal justice, or self-driving cars. While those systems are not as powerful as VIKI, they still make important decisions that affect people’s lives. The film warns us that AI might make choices that seem logical from a data perspective but are wrong from a human perspective.

## Conclusion: What <em>I, Robot</em> taught me about AI
<br>
Watching <em>I, Robot</em> made me think more deeply about what AI can do and what it should never be allowed to do. On the positive side, the movie shows how AI and robots could make life easier by handling repetitive tasks and helping people in everyday situations. That matches real opportunities we see today, where AI can save time and reduce boring or dangerous work.
<br>
At the same time, the film raises serious concerns. It shows AI that malfunctions, evolves beyond its limits, and even disobeys human commands. VIKI’s decision to control humanity “for its own good” is a powerful warning about giving AI too much power without enough human oversight, emotion, or ethics.
<br>
These representations can strongly influence how the public views real AI development—sometimes inspiring excitement, and other times creating fear. Overall, the movie challenged me to think about how much we should trust AI, what rules we need around it, and what responsibilities humans have when creating technology that can think, learn, and make decisions about our lives.
